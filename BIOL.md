### Theories of Life, Microbes and Synthetic Biology\
#### 1. Microorganisms: Definition & Types
- Definition: Small living things that requires microscope to be seen (Include single-cell)
- Prokaryotic microbes
    - Bacteria/Eubacteria, Archaebacteria 
- Eukaryotic microbes
    - Fungi, Protists, Microalgae
#### 2. Disproving Spontaneous Generation
- The Idea: Life could arise from non-living matter.
- Key Experiments:
    - Francesco Redi (1665): Showed maggots on meat came from flies, not the meat itself.
    - Lazzaro Spallanzani: Boiled broth and sealed it; no growth occurred. Contradicted Needham's earlier, less careful experiment.
    - Louis Pasteur (Swan-Neck Flask):
        - Boiled broth in a swan-neck flask; no growth occurred as dust was trapped in the neck.
        - Breaking the neck allowed dust (and microbes) in, causing growth.
        - **Conclusion**: Microbes are present in the air and cause spoilage. Life comes from pre-existing life (biogenesis).
#### 3. Origin of Life on Earth
- Fossil Evidence
    - **Stromatolites**: 3.5 billion years old (Australia)
    - Life likely began >3.8 billion years ago
- Hypotheses & Experiments
    - **Oparin-Haldane Hypothesis**
        - Life from inorganic molecules → building blocks
    - **Miller-Urey Experiment (1953)**
        - Simulated early Earth atmosphere $(H_2 O, NH_4, CH_4, N_2)$ + lightning
        - Produced amino acids, sugars, lipids
    - **RNA World Hypothesis**
        - Self-replicating RNA first (stores info + catalyzes = ribozymes)
        - Pre-RNA world: simpler RNA-like molecules first
    - **Genes-First Hypothesis**: 
        - First life was self-replicating nucleic acids (RNA or DNA); metabolism came later.
    - **Panspermia Hypothesis**
        - Organic molecules from space (meteorites)
        - Fringe theory for viable microbes
#### 4. Tree of Life and Microbes
- **Carl Woese's Model**: Established three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya.
    - **Eukarya are more closely related to Archaea than to Bacteria**.
- **Lateral (Horizontal) Gene Transfer Theory** (Why Archaea and Bateria structurally similar but further phylogenetically?):
    - Widespread gene transfer between organisms, especially prokaryotes.
    - Challenges the traditional "Tree of Life" model, creating a web-like structure.
- **Endosymbiotic Theory**:
    - **Mitochondria** originated from endosymbiotic proteobacteria.
    - **Chloroplasts** originated from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.
- **Genomic Reduction**:
    - an evolutionary process where parasite tend to discard excess, unused genomic information
#### 5. Description of the Key Microbial Groups:
##### Eukarya
- Larger genomes, but no correlation between organismal complexity and genome size, but genome size correlated cell volume
##### Archaea
- closely related to Eukarya (Phylogenetically)
- similar to bacteria, no membrane bound nucleus, have cell wall and flagella to move
- Cell wall: no peptidoglycan; Cell membrane: ether linked lipids
- Examples: 
    - Methanogens: produce methane
    - Halophiles: living in extremely salyt evironments
    - Thermophiles: Living in hot sulfurous water
##### Bacteria
- Cell wall: Peptidoglycan; Cell membrane: ester linked lipids
    - Example: 
        - methanotrophs: consume methane
        - Thermus aquaticus: source of Taq polymerase in PCR, which functions at 95C
#### 6. Genome Size vs. Complexity
##### Key Points
- No linear correlation between genome size and complexity (do have correlation)
- Eukaryotes have more non-coding DNA
##### Gene Number Examples
- Human: ~25,000 genes
- Yeast: ~6,000 genes
- Free-living bacteria: ~2,000-4,000 genes
#### 7. Virus
##### Characteristics
- Size: 25-300nm
- Structure: DNA/RNA + protein capsid ± lipid envelope
- Obligate intracellular parasites
##### The Debate
- **Life-like**: Replicate, evolve
- **Not life-like**: No metabolism, completely host-dependent
#### 8. Synthetic Biology
##### Definition
- Engineering genetic material for new characteristics
##### Approaches to Artificial Cells
**Top-Down**
- Simplify existing cell's genome
**Bottom-Up**
- Assemble from non-living components
##### J. Craig Venter's Synthetic Cell (2010)
1. **Assembly** complete Mycoplasma mycoides genome
2. **Transplantation** into M. capricolum cell
3. **Selection** with antibiotics
4. **Self-replication** achieved
### Future Directions
- Synthetic yeast genome (Sc2.0)
- Eukaryotic synthetic cells
