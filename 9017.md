## I. Combinatorial Games and Zermelo’s Theorem
### Definition:
- **Strategy**: A strategy of a player is a **complete plan** for playing a game, taking all contingencies into account, including possible moves of the opponent.
    - **Winning Strategy**: A strategy that enables a player to win **no matter what moves the opponent makes**.
    - **Drawing strategy**: A strategy that guarantees that the player **does not lose**. 
- **Zermelo's Theorem**: 
    - **Finite Game**: A game that **terminates in finite number of moves**. 
    - **Perfect Information**: A game that **all players** can aware of **all aspects** of the structure of the game at **all times**. (No probability)
    - **Combinatorial Game**: Any **two-person game** of **perfect information** that moves **alternatively** is combinatorial game. (Can be not finite)
    - $\rightarrow$ Any **finite combinatorial game** that **cannot ends in a draw**, then one of the player must have a **dominant strategy**
- **Nash’s Strategy Stealing Argument**: In any symmetric game in which an extra move an never be a disadvantage, the first player has the dominant strategy. 
    - **Symmetric Game**: Either player has the same set of available moves

## II. Game theory
### Definition:
- **Solution of the Game**: The decision of the players
- **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy which is always better than any other strategy, regardless of what opponents may do.
- **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**: The **solution (outcome)** when all the players choose their **dominant strategy**, so every player will ot change their decision anymore
- **Nash Equilibrium**: The solution of the game when no individual will change their position, **given the others do not change their positions**. 
    - Dominant strategy equilibrium $\subset$ Nash equilibrium
- **Mixed Strategy**: A mixed strategy of a player in a **repeated game** is **a probability distribution** over the player’s strategies.
    - **Pure Strategy**: A **mixed strategy** that the probability of choosing one strategy is 1
- **Mixed Nash Equilibrium**: The solution if no individual will change his mixed strategy, **given that the others do not change their mixed strategies**.
- **Nash Nobel-Prize-Winning Theorem**: Every finite n-player non cooperative game has a mixed Nash Equilibrium.
### How to find the Mixed Nash Equilirbium (Mixed Strategy)?
- Suppose $(p^*, q^*)$ is the mixed Nash Equilibrium, where $0 \le p^*, q^* \le 1$
- $$ \begin{align*}
    & EU(L_i) = \sum_{k=1}^n p_{ik} u(x_k) \\
    & \implies E_A(p^*, q^*) \geq E_A(p, q^*), E_B(p^*, q^*) \ge E_A(p^*, q) \\
    & \implies E_K(p, q) = p q (k_{11} + k_{22} - k_{12} - k_{21}) + p (k_{21} - k_{22}) + q (k_{12} - k_{22}) + k_{22} \\
    & \implies \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial p} = q (a_{11} + a_{22} - a_{12} - a_{21}) + (a_{21} - a_{22}) \bigg|_{q = q^*} = 0 \\
    & \implies \frac{\partial E_B}{\partial q} = p (b_{11} + b_{22} - b_{12} - b_{21}) + (b_{12} - b_{22}) \bigg|_{p = p^*} = 0 \\
    & \implies (p^*, q^*) = \left( \frac{a_{22} - a_{21}}{a_{11} + a_{22} - a_{12} - a_{21}}, \frac{b_{22} - b_{21}}{b_{11} + b_{22} - b_{12} - b_{21}} \right) \end{align*}$$
- or without calculus, when $0 < p^*, q^* < 1$ $$\begin{cases}
E_A(1, q^*) = E_A(0, q*) \\
E_B(p^*, 1) = E_B(p^*, 0) \\ \end{cases}$$

## III. Autions
### Definition:
- English Aution: The auctioneer begins with the lowest acceptable price (reserve price), increases til one bidder remains
- Dutch Aution: Begins at high level, and lowers until a bidder takes the price
- First price sealed-bid auction: Bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bid wins, and pays one's bid
- Second price sealed-bid auction: Bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bid wins, by paying the second highest cost
- What is the dominant strategy?
    - Bid their **True value**
    - Dutch and First price are "Strategically equivalent" as $$\begin{cases}
    v_i - b_i \quad \text{if i wins} \\
    0 \quad \text{if i loses} \\ \end{cases}$$
    - English and Second price are "Strategically equivalent" when b is the 2nd highest bid as $$\begin{cases}
    v_i - b \quad \text{if i wins} \\
    0 \quad \text{if i loses} \\ \end{cases}$$
    - If we assume bidders would bid higher in Second-price as we know we will pay less, we can say that Second-price is somehow similar to First-price
