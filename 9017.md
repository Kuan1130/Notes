## I. Combinatorial Games and Zermelo’s Theorem
### Definition:
- **Strategy**: A strategy of a player is a **complete plan** for playing a game, taking all contingencies into account, including possible moves of the opponent.
    - **Winning Strategy**: A strategy that enables a player to win **no matter what moves the opponent makes**.
    - **Drawing strategy**: A strategy that guarantees that the player **does not lose**. 
- **Zermelo's Theorem**: 
    - **Finite Game**: A game that **terminates in finite number of moves**. 
    - **Perfect Information**: A game that **all players** can aware of **all aspects** of the structure of the game at **all times**. (No probability)
    - **Combinatorial Game**: Any **two-person game** of **perfect information** that moves **alternatively** is combinatorial game. (Can be not finite)
    - $\rightarrow$ Any **finite combinatorial game** that **cannot ends in a draw**, then one of the player must have a **dominant strategy**
- **Nash’s Strategy Stealing Argument**: In any symmetric game in which an extra move an never be a disadvantage, the first player has the dominant strategy. 
    - **Symmetric Game**: Either player has the same set of available moves

## II. Game theory
### Definition:
- **Solution of the Game**: The decision of the players
- **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy which is always better than any other strategy, regardless of what opponents may do.
- **Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**: The **solution (outcome)** when all the players choose their **dominant strategy**, so every player will ot change their decision anymore
- **Nash Equilibrium**: The solution of the game when no individual will change their position, **given the others do not change their positions**. 
    - Dominant strategy equilibrium $\subset$ Nash equilibrium
- **Mixed Strategy**: A mixed strategy of a player in a **repeated game** is **a probability distribution** over the player’s strategies.
    - **Pure Strategy**: A **mixed strategy** that the probability of choosing one strategy is 1
- **Mixed Nash Equilibrium**: The solution if no individual will change his mixed strategy, **given that the others do not change their mixed strategies**.
- **Nash Nobel-Prize-Winning Theorem**: Every finite n-player non cooperative game has a mixed Nash Equilibrium.
### How to find the Mixed Nash Equilirbium (Mixed Strategy)?
- Suppose $(p^*, q^*)$ is the mixed Nash Equilibrium, where $0 \le p^*, q^* \le 1$
- $$ \begin{align*}
    & EU(L_i) = \sum_{k=1}^n p_{ik} u(x_k) \\
    & \implies E_A(p^*, q^*) \geq E_A(p, q^*), E_B(p^*, q^*) \ge E_A(p^*, q) \\
    & \implies E_K(p, q) = p q (k_{11} + k_{22} - k_{12} - k_{21}) + p (k_{21} - k_{22}) + q (k_{12} - k_{22}) + k_{22} \\
    & \implies \frac{\partial E_A}{\partial p} = q (a_{11} + a_{22} - a_{12} - a_{21}) + (a_{21} - a_{22}) \bigg|_{q = q^*} = 0 \\
    & \implies \frac{\partial E_B}{\partial q} = p (b_{11} + b_{22} - b_{12} - b_{21}) + (b_{12} - b_{22}) \bigg|_{p = p^*} = 0 \\
    & \implies (p^*, q^*) = \left( \frac{a_{22} - a_{21}}{a_{11} + a_{22} - a_{12} - a_{21}}, \frac{b_{22} - b_{21}}{b_{11} + b_{22} - b_{12} - b_{21}} \right) \end{align*}$$
- or without calculus, when $0 < p^*, q^* < 1$ $$\begin{cases}
E_A(1, q^*) = E_A(0, q*) \\
E_B(p^*, 1) = E_B(p^*, 0) \\ \end{cases}$$

## III. Autions
### Definition:
- English Aution: The auctioneer begins with the lowest acceptable price (reserve price), increases til one bidder remains
- Dutch Aution: Begins at high level, and lowers until a bidder takes the price
- First price sealed-bid auction: Bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bid wins, and pays one's bid
- Second price sealed-bid auction: Bid in a sealed envelope, and the highest bid wins, by paying the second highest cost
- What is the dominant strategy?
    - Bid their **True value**
    - Dutch and First price are "Strategically equivalent" as $$\begin{cases}
    v_i - b_i \quad \text{if i wins} \\
    0 \quad \text{if i loses} \\ \end{cases}$$
    - English and Second price are "Strategically equivalent" when b is the 2nd highest bid as $$\begin{cases}
    v_i - b \quad \text{if i wins} \\
    0 \quad \text{if i loses} \\ \end{cases}$$
    - If we assume bidders would bid higher in Second-price as we know we will pay less, we can say that Second-price is somehow similar to First-price

## IV. Shapley Value
### Prequisites:
- Let there are $n \ge 2$ players, so $N = {1, 2, ..., N}$ is the set of players
- S is a coalition if $S \subseteq N$, and the set of all coalitions is $2^N$ $$2^N = \{S|S \subseteq N\}$$
- $\varnothing$ is the **empty coalition**, while $N$ is the **grand coalition**
- For a game of coalitional form $(N;v)$, consist of 
    - (a set of) N players
    - a real-value function $\mathbb{v}$ defined on $2^N = \{ S|S \subseteq N\}$ such that $\boxed{v(\varnothing) = 0}$
    - Function $\mathbb{v}$ is called **coalition function/characteristic function**, $v(S)$ is the **value/worth** of coalition S
### Axioms for players in (N;v):
- I. Symmetric Players/Substitutes
    - $$\text{if } i, j \notin S, \text{ for all } S, v(S \cup \{ i \}) = v(S \cup \{ j \})$$
- II. Null Players
    - $$v(S \cup \{ i \}) = v(S) \text{ for all } S \subset N \implies v(i) = 0$$
- III. Sum of Games
    - $$(N;v) \text{ is the sum of two games } (N;u) \text{ and } (N;w),  \\ \text{ if for every } S \subset N, v(S) = u(S) + w(S)$$
### Shapley Value Theorems:
- I. There exists a unique Shapley $\phi = (\phi_1, ...,\phi_n)$
- II. The Shapley value is $$\phi_i \;=\; \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}\Bigl(v\bigl(N_{i}^{\sigma}\cup\{i\}\bigr)-v\bigl(N_{i}^{\sigma}\bigr)\Bigr)$$
    - where $N_{i}^{\sigma}$ represents the set of players preceding $i$ in $N$ corresponding to the permutation $\sigma$ on $N$
### Two ways to find Shapley values:
#### Spliting method
- split into **carrier games**
    - A carrier game (N;v) is a game in which there is a coalition T, which is the carrier, such that
$$\begin{cases} v(S) = v(T), \text{ whenever }T \subset S \\ v(S) = 0 \text{ otherwise} \\ \end{cases}$$
- Table by the formula
```math
$$\begin{array}{lccc}
    & \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{2} & \mathbf{3} \\[4pt]
    123 & a_{123,1} & a_{123,2} & a_{123,3} \\
    132 & a_{132,1} & a_{132,2} & a_{132,3} \\
    213 & a_{213,1} & a_{213,2} & a_{213,3} \\
    231 & a_{231,1} & a_{231,2} & a_{231,3} \\
    312 & a_{312,1} & a_{312,2} & a_{312,3} \\
    321 & a_{321,1} & a_{321,2} & a_{321,3} \\[4pt]
    \mathbf{\phi_i} & \text{sum/n!} & \text{sum/n!} & \text{sum/n!} \\
\end{array}$$
