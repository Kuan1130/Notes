## I. Combinatorial Games and Zermelo’s Theorem
### Definitions:
- **Strategy**: A strategy of a player is a **complete plan** for playing a game, taking all contingencies into account, including possible moves of the opponent.
    - **Winning Strategy**: A strategy that enables a player to win **no matter what moves the opponent makes**.
    - **Drawing strategy**: A strategy that guarantees that the player **does not lose**. 
- **Zermelo's Theorem**: 
    - **Finite game**: A game that **terminates in finite number of moves**. 
    - **Perfect Information**: A game that **all players** can aware of **all aspects** of the structure of the game at **all times**. (No probability)
    - **Combinatorial game**: Any **two-person game** of **perfect information** that moves **alternatively** is combinatorial game. (Can be not finite)
    - $\rightarrow$ Any **finite combinatorial game** that **cannot ends in a draw**, then one of the player must have a **dominant strategy**
- **Nash’s strategy stealing argument**: In any symmetric game in which an extra move an never be a disadvantage, the first player has the dominant strategy. 
    - **Symmetric game**: Either player has the same set of available moves
